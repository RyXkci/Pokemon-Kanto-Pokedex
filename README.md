POKEMON KANTO REGION POKEDEX.

This is a small app that makes use of the Pokemon api.

It has a "front" section with the form input and a "back" section where the data will be appended.

It searches the api for a Pokèmon based on the user input, filters to make sure that it is a Pokèmon that is part of the original 151, then using Javascript it selects types, moves TM/HM moves, stats and the sprite from the api response, appends it to the dom in the "back" section, then animates "front section" to reveal the back section once all the data is appended.

Also, I included a little easter egg for the players in case they input a Pokèmon from another generation! (Or something that isn't a pokemon at all)

All Vanilla CSS and Vanilla JS.
